# Project 0

## Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project0 is a simple website with the explanation of some basic optical phenomena.

The index.html file representes the homepage, with links to all the other pages. On each of them, there's a home button on the navigator bar to get back.

In the pages, you'll find some explanation, figures and, when necessary, some equations added with MathJax support for TeX format.
