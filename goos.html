            <p>
                When the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angles, total reflection occurs. However, something much weirder happens: the Goos-HÃ¤nchen shift. This effect consists of a slight lateral shift in the beam trajectory, as the image below shows.

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                This shift, however, is only noticeable with very precise measuring equipment, as its order of magnitude is the same of the wavelength: \(\mu\)m (\(10^{-6}\) m). For comparison, a human hair is about \(100\ \mu\)m. Although small, this shift is important to some applications. The explanation of the phenomenon and its quantification is hard and involve some advanced math, so it will not be discussed here. If you want to see it anyway, you can visit my work <a href="https://github.com/leonardosrodrigues0/project0/raw/master/IC.pdf" >here</a>.
